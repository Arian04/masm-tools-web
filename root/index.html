    <h1>What is this site?</h1>
    <p>
      This is the landing page for several useful MASM projects or websites.
      It's meant as a resource for students being taught MASM in a course. For
      this reason, everything here is written with the 8th edition of "Assembly
      Language for x86 Processors" by Kip Irvine in mind. If you aren't using
      that textbook. Some of these resources may not be relevant to you.

HTML-ified documentation for the Irvine library used in [Assembly Language for x86 Processors, 8th edition](http://www.asmirvine.com/) by Kip Irvine. The [original file](http://www.asmirvine.com/files/IrvineLibHelp.exe) is distributed as a self-extracting EXE file that contains a CHM file. I decided to host it to make it easier for people to access it.


It's deployed using Github Actions + Github Pages, so if that file is ever updated (I doubt it, since it was last modified in 2005), then all I need to do is update the file's checksum and everything will re-deploy. So if this happens, feel free to create an issue or pull request.
